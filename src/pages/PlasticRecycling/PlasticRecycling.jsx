                    Plastic, also known as polymer, is one of the most demanded and widely accepted products in today’s world.  It is one of human’s best inventions but the problem is, it is produced too many, at too little time and hence, its waste has just been piling up.

                    In Nepal, plastics account for almost 15% of the total waste generated. Accumulation of plastic debris has been choking our rivers, polluting our environment, and overwhelming our landfills. The unfortunate part about plastic waste disposal in Nepal is that it is mostly thrown into landfills along with other waste or is discarded in the open environment.

                <p>
                Due to its non-biodegradable nature, plastics in landfills break down into smaller pieces, called microplastics. Plastics in open environments cause land, air, and water pollution. When incinerated, plastics release harmful dioxins, furans, mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls into the atmosphere. Hence, the current waste management scenario of Nepal demands a holistic and robust approach to the plastic waste problem.
