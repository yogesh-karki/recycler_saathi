Plastics, if not collected and managed properly will contaminate and affect waterways and ecosystems for thousands of years. Given the importance of solid waste management, especially in a developing country like Nepal, many schools still fail to mobilize the primary agents of change; our youths. They struggle with providing basic awareness on good waste practices such as segregation, recycling, and upcycling to their students and to practice it in their schools. Moreover, many schools despite having the resources to reach young children in their community do not plan to do so. This is often due to the lack of knowledge, support, guidance, and connections.

However, what about the informal and formal waste workers who contribute greatly to the Solid Waste Management sector of Nepal? The waste management sector in under developing countries is a dangerous and underpaid sector with many disadvantages associated such as lack of formal recognition, discrimination, lack of safety nets, etc. A range of policy and regulatory measures, along with interventions that promote greater social inclusion and occupational support is missing.

                    Recycler Saathi, in association with its supporters and partners, provide entrepreneurial training, health facilities, and social support to our partners in the waste management sector. We conduct surveys to outline the needs and working environment of waste workers, implement micro-entrepreneurial training, conduct mobile health camps, donate safety kits and gears, and integrate scrap dealers and balers into a fair price system to establish standard pricing and margins.

                    We organize consultation meetings with relevant stakeholders to improve labor laws, provide insurance schemes, and introduce legal contract systems. We continuously partner with international organizations and corporations to introduce various projects to benefit the formal and informal waste workers of Nepal. Recycler Saathi provides certification and identity cards to waste workers to allow them legal status and enjoy labor rights ensured by national policies.

                    Our annual Hamro Cycle Yatra rally publicly honors waste workers and admires their remarkable involvement to keep our environment clean and healthy. It is a symbol of unity where local government, private institutes, youths, and the waste workers of the city come together to promote the importance of recycling and the overall waste management sector in fighting environmental pollution on our planet. Till date, more than 800 waste workers and 600 public members have attended the rally in Kathmandu and Chitwan. Similarly, we provide Occupational Safety Training at various recollection and baling centers in the country.

                        Between 2019-2020, a recollection and baling center was established in Laxmipur, Ward no.4 Bharatpur, Chitwan. It was constructed and designed in an environment-friendly way and is equipped with baling machines and other basic facilities. The location also includes an educational hub for the youths to work on environment and sustainability programs focused on recycling. The center maintains a vegetable garden and has planted various species of trees and plants.

                        The center started its recollection of PET waste bottles from existing actors. In that year, it collected 889.97 tons of waste PET bottles. It also partnered with various waste management companies and recollection centers, to establish a medium between waste workers, balers, and Recycler Saathi for the overall recollection and recycling process. Furthermore, Ganesha Overseas, a subsidiary of Ganesha Ecosphere Ltd was established in Parasi, Nepal. It is the collection point for baled PET bottles supplied by Recycler Sathi to be sent for recycling. The facility is equipped with a capacity production of 1000 metric tons of flakes and granules.

The museum is installed with five bottle crushers, LED boards, informative posters, and three waste segregation dustbins at source.
