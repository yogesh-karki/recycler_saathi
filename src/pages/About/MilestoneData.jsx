                    Recycler Saathi was incepted with an aim to create a self-sustaining waste PET bottle recycling mechanism in Nepal aligning with the vision of The Coca-Cola Foundation’s ‘World Without Waste’. The broader goal of the project has been to formalize the waste management sector of Nepal and create a reliable and sustainable recycling mechanism in Nepal.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In alignment with Recycler Saathi’s goals to establish a proper recycling system within Nepal and enhance the waste management sector, it has focused on recollection and recycling of waste PET bottles, capacity development and livelihood enhancement of waste workers. The project further prioritizes an attitude shift among households and institutions towards recycling and waste workers.

                    We receive used plastic bottles from informal waste workers, several suppliers (including waste-collecting organizations), and individuals contributing to keep their surrounding clean. After being sorted and cleaned, the plastic bottles go through a recycling process. The processed raw material can be further used multiple times. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Recollection and recycling of used PET bottles will not just make the environment clean but will be contributing to formalizingthe  waste management system within Nepal, benefitting waste workers and improving their health conditions, supporting their families (women and children).

                    Recycler Saathi set sight on establishing a Self-Sustainable Recycling Center with Streamlined Recollection Mechanism. The construction of a waste PET bottles recollection and recycling center went underway in Laxmipur, Bharatpur of Chitwan. The Recollection and Recycling Center was also facilitated with a learning hub for people to visit and learn about PET and the process of recycling. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The recollection of waste PET bottles from existing actors include:  
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>3 waste PET bottle balers</li>
                        <li>15 PET collecting groups identified in the Bharatpur area </li>

                        During the first cycle of Recyler Saathi we were able to launch three major programs:  
                    </p>

                    <h5>Waste Smart School </h5>

                    <p>
                    Waste Smart School is an initiative to provide an environment-friendly and environment-conscious outlook to students and young children. We ensure students receive exposure and a well-rounded knowledge about the waste management scenario and individual as well as community-level practices for environmental protection. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Clean City, Our Responsibility </h5>
                    <p>
                    We ran an awareness campaign in joint collaboration with Coca-Cola Bottlers Nepal (Terai) Ltd., Green Nepal City Waste Management and CREASION throughout the duration of the 12th Chitwan Mahotsav (8-18 Jan 2019). It brought the audience’s attention on the importance of source-segregation, respecting waste workers and the PET bottles recycling process. The campaign successfully had an outreach of 5000+ visitors. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Beat Air pollution </h5>
                    <p>
                    A week-long program from May 29 to June 5, 2019 was organized to celebrate ‘47th World Environment Day’ with the support of Bharatpur Metropolitan City, Office of Municipal Executive–Bharatpur, Coca-Cola Bottlers Nepal (Terai) Ltd., Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chitwan, Time Pharmaceuticals Private Limited, Waste Smart Schools, doctors, PET balers, waste workers and our team of volunteers. 
                    </p> 

                    <h5>Celebrity Engagements   </h5>
                    <p>
                    Mr. Dayahang Rai, one of the most popular and acclaimed actors in Nepal, joined us to represent the visions of Recycler Saathi as its Goodwill Ambassador. He has shown a keen interest in being a part of this project and has actively participated in various activities of the project. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Stakeholders Consultation Meeting on ‘Towards Zero Waste Sauraha Vision 2020’  </h5>
                    <p>
                    Advancing one step further from the initiative of making Chitwan National Park first plastic-free protected area of Nepal, a plan of complete waste management of ward 5, 6 and 7 of Ratnanagar Municipality covering the entire community of Sauraha (the eastern gateway to Chitwan National Park) was proposed by CREASION and supported by all the stakeholders. In collaborative decision of representatives from Chitwan National Park Committee, Mrigakunja Buffer Zone User Committee, Coca-Cola/BNTL, WWF Nepal, Digo Waste Management and Environment Protection Cooperative, Green Nepal City Waste Management, CREASION, Ecoprise BioSolutions, and Clean City Cooperative, America, the ‘Towards Zero Waste Sauraha Vision 2020’ mission proposed to manage and recover the complete municipal waste by the year 2020 which also marked Tourism Year of Nepal. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Oath Taking Ceremony for Waste Smart Schools  </h5>
                    <p>
                    Oath Taking Ceremony was organized for the members of Waste Smart Clubs of various Waste Smart Schools from August 21 to August 23, 2019. The clubs consist of eleven members who are designated with different positions such as President, Vice-President, Communication Manager and so on. The oath-taking ceremony featured the members of the club taking a pledge to work towards a better environment not just inside their schools but also in their community. The formalization of the clubs through the oath-taking ceremony was a good start to help the members develop a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the club and its activities. The ceremony also featured the handing over of Waste Smart Club Kit and certain amount of seed fund for the effective functioning of the clubs. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Mobile Library for Waste Smart Schools  </h5>
                    <p>
                    Recycler Saathi as part of Waste Smart Club campaign installed reading corners in five Waste Smart Schools in collaboration with Kathalaya Inc., a publishing house. The installations were done in August 2019. The reading corners each housed a total of 100 quality pictorial storybooks. The main aim of the project was to inculcate a reading habit in the children not just for the purpose of gaining new knowledge but also as a means to achieve sound mental health. Along with the handover, the event included a workshop for students to improve their reading, learning, writing and speaking skills. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Workshop for youths by international experts  </h5>
                    <p>
                    With the aim of looking into the prospects of turning Recycler Saathi into a sustainable research center, Recycler Saathi hosted James Dean Conklin, filmmaker, director, and climate activist; and Elisa Zazzera, compost master, at its office in Bharatpur, Chitwan. The couple observed the bailing operations and construction works in the Recycler Saathi site and provided their suggestions on how we could add more eco-friendly components to our works. They also held an interaction with our volunteers where they acquainted them with multiple aspects of composting and recycling.

                    Recycler Saathi 2.0, an extension of Recycler Saathi 1.0 that has been continued with the aim of creating a self-sustainable waste PET bottle recycling mechanism in Nepal. Recycler Saathi 1.0 aligns with the vision of The Coca-Cola Foundation’s ‘World Without Waste’. After a year of its operation and attainment of its planned outcome of recollection of 895 Tons of waste PET bottles and other related impacts in first cycle, Recycler Saathi 2.0, the second cycle of the project, was launched in September 2020.

                    <h5>PET Recovery </h5>

                    <p>
                    The pandemic has brought significant shifts in the economy, and most sectors that were not in the mainstream, such as the recycling industry, were hit hard. Recycler Saathi faced its own set of challenges but did not let the circumstance control its operation. In the first half of the second cycle of the project, Recycler Saathi 2.0 has recollected 629 tons of waste PET bottles, achieving more than 60 percent of its recovery target. This resulted in positive environmental impacts such as a reduction in 944 Tons of carbon emission. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Research and Expansion </h5>
                    <p>
                    Recycler Saathi team traveled far and wide from the eastern parts of Nepal to the western parts researching and interacting with PET balers about the possibilities and potential of recycling in Nepal. The assessments were carried out in Kawasoti, Butwal, Bhairawaha and Nepalgunj with the identification of over 12 major balers and two association groups active in the sector of waste management. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Consortium of PET Balers </h5>
                    <p>
                    Recycler Saathi’s goals of formalizing the waste management sector of Nepal requires coordination and collaboration with other partners and stakeholders-especially balers. Putting this into consideration, it has sought out for multiple collaborations with waste management stakeholders and expanded its network throughout Nepal. Multiple rounds of meeting between Recycler Saathi team and local balers of Chitwan of meetings have been arranged with major actors in the PET recollection and recycling sectors from different districts of Nepal. The partnerships have helped strengthen recovery strategy, regulate a fair pricing system and secure continuous supply of scrap PET bottles within the Recycler Saathi ecosystem.
                    </p> 

                    <h5>Strengthening of Baling Center and Informal Waste Workers</h5>
                    <p>
                    As part of Recycler Saathi’s one of primary goals to work for the welfare of waste workers, a stakeholders consultation meeting was organized to provide them information about out labor laws and insurance schemes. A total of 15 balers from Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur districts attended the session and familiarized themselves with existing labor laws of Nepal and how they can better ensure the safety of their workers through relevant insurance schemes.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Women in Waste  </h5>
                    <p>
                    Women involved in the waste sector play an elementary role but their welfare is still not prioritized. In acknowledgment of this issue, Recycler Saathi has always extended its support for waste workers who identify as women. Recycler Saathi 2.0 also gave continuity to this and provided safety and capacity building training sessions for 64 women working in the collection centers of Chitwan.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Occupational Safety Training and Health Camp  </h5>
                    <p>
                    Recycler Saathi’s extended its activities for the welfare of waste workers by organizing yet another Occupational Safety Training and Health Camp for 67 waste workers in their respective baling stations around Kathmandu and Lalitpur. The program, at each site, involved training for waste workers on hygiene maintenance at work through demonstrations on hand-washing, wearing and removing masks and gloves, and use of safety gear while at work. It also included a separate training session for waste workers who identified as women regarding the use of reusable menstrual pads.    
                    </p>

                    <h5>Mobile Library for Waste Smart Schools  </h5>

                    The occupational safety training and health campaign is a program conducted for bringing awareness on occupational safety to the health workers. We were able to conduct these sessions in three bailing centers in Kathmandu and Lalitpur, reaching 70 waste workers. The training session consisted of demonstrations such as proper ways to wash hands, remove gloves, and in case of any emergencies, how to use a fire extinguisher. The waste collection center was presented with a bucket, fire extinguisher, shovel, and safety helmets for safety measures in case of a fire hazard. Individual waste workers were provided with safety gear such as masks, gloves, shoes, and safety suits that work in dumping sites and landfills and are exposed to different types of waste materials that could harm them.

                    The occupational safety training and health campaign is a program conducted for bringing awareness on occupational safety to the health workers. We were able to conduct these sessions in three bailing centers in Kathmandu and Lalitpur, reaching 70 waste workers. The training session consisted of demonstrations such as proper ways to wash hands, remove gloves, and in case of any emergencies, how to use a fire extinguisher. The waste collection center was presented with a bucket, fire extinguisher, shovel, and safety helmets for safety measures in case of a fire hazard. Individual waste workers were provided with safety gear such as masks, gloves, shoes, and safety suits that work in dumping sites and landfills and are exposed to different types of waste materials that could harm them.

                    The training also included a health checkup for the waste workers by Dr. Sandesh Ghimire, the medical consultant who conducted a thorough check-up of the waste workers present in the facility. Along with that, they were also provided with safety jackets, T-shirts, and shoes.
